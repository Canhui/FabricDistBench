The study was undertaken in two stages: (i) interviews in 2016 that examine the barriers and drivers of diffusion; followed by (ii) a case study in 2019 of the Italian wine industry’s permissioned blockchain. The results show that diffusion is reaching a final stage for permissionless blockchains but is lagging behind for permissioned blockchains due to the different barriers and drivers of diffusion. The implications from this study are that: (i) drivers and barriers for different types of technological innovation may be different and change over time; (ii) initial barriers may be surmounted and become features of the underlying technology; (iii) barriers may become drivers of a technology; (iv) drivers of one type of technology may spill-over to become drivers for another type; (v) diffusion may be measured by both the number of adoptions and the number of participants in that technology; (vi) off-chain processes may become a major barrier for permissioned blockchains; and finally (vii) self-interest may be the key driver of technological innovation.}

Currently, permissionless blockchain has shown a good application prospect in many fields, from the initial cryptocurrency to the Internet of Things (IoT) and Vehicular Ad-Hoc Networking (VANET), which is considered as the beginning of rewriting our digital infrastructure. However, blockchain confronts some privacy risks that hinder its practical applications. Though numerous surveys reviewed the privacy preservation in blockchain, they failed to reveal the latest advances, nor have they been able to conduct a unified standard comprehensive classification of the privacy protection of permissionless blockchain. Therefore, in this paper, we analyze the specific characteristics of permissionless blockchain, summarize the potential privacy threats, and investigate the unique privacy requirements of blockchain. Existing privacy preservation technologies are carefully surveyed and evaluated based on our proposed evaluation criteria. We finally figure out open research issues as well as future research directions from the perspective of privacy issues.}

However, healthcare records that contain confidential patient data make this system very complicated because there is a risk of a privacy breach. This study aims to address research into the applications of the blockchain healthcare area. It sets out by discussing the management of medical information, as well as the sharing of medical records, image sharing, and log management. We also discuss papers that intersect with other areas, such as the Internet of Things, the management of information, tracking of drugs along their supply chain, and aspects of security and privacy. As we are aware that there are other surveys of blockchain in healthcare, we analyze and compare both the positive and negative aspects of their papers. Finally, we seek to examine the concepts of blockchain in the medical area, by assessing their benefits and drawbacks and thus giving guidance to other researchers in the area. Additionally, we summarize the methods used in healthcare per application area and show their pros and cons.},

abstract = {Fabric is a modular and extensible open-source system for deploying and operating permissioned blockchains and one of the Hyperledger projects hosted by the Linux Foundation (www.hyperledger.org).Fabric is the first truly extensible blockchain system for running distributed applications. It supports modular consensus protocols, which allows the system to be tailored to particular use cases and trust models. Fabric is also the first blockchain system that runs distributed applications written in standard, general-purpose programming languages, without systemic dependency on a native cryptocurrency. This stands in sharp contrast to existing block-chain platforms that require "smart-contracts" to be written in domain-specific languages or rely on a cryptocurrency. Fabric realizes the permissioned model using a portable notion of membership, which may be integrated with industry-standard identity management. To support such flexibility, Fabric introduces an entirely novel blockchain design and revamps the way blockchains cope with non-determinism, resource exhaustion, and performance attacks.This paper describes Fabric, its architecture, the rationale behind various design decisions, its most prominent implementation aspects, as well as its distributed application programming model. We further evaluate Fabric by implementing and benchmarking a Bitcoin-inspired digital currency. We show that Fabric achieves end-to-end throughput of more than 3500 transactions per second in certain popular deployment configurations, with sub-second latency, scaling well to over 100 peers.},

The migration to DLT is expected to have a negative performance impact, but some DLTs, such as Hyperledger Fabric, are accepted to be much better suited performance-wise to such use cases than others. However, with the somewhat surprising, but ongoing absence of application-level performance benchmarks for DLTs, cross-DLT comparison for "classic" workloads and the evaluation of the performance impact of "blockchainification" is still ill-supported. We present the design and Hyperledger Caliper-based open implementation of a full port of the classic TPC-C benchmark to Hyperledger Fabric, complete with a structured approach for transforming the original database schema to a smart contract data model. Initial measurements about the workload characteristics that will affect the design of large-scale performance evaluations are also included.},

This leaves the intellectual property of the organizations and the personal information of the students vulnerable to leakage should the central server be attacked. In this study, the researchers propose a multilateral personal portfolio authentication system that guarantees the reliability, integrity, and transparency of the data such as learner's schooling history. The system uses the features of blockchain in a distributed network wherein a learner submits schooling data to a peer in the network. The data is then verified through an agreement among the peers and recorded in a chronologically encrypted ledger. The proposed system is implemented based on Hyperledger Fabric and the analysis thereof conducted by evaluating its processing speed, capacity, and security. The analysis indicates that the system is able to successfully intercept the transactions of unvalidated users, thereby preventing the recording of incorrect data by an unauthorized user. Furthermore, it provides a record of previously made changes to a learner's profile, thus improving the integrity and reliability of the data. This system provides a platform to share learner information safely and promptly among schools, certification authorities, and higher learning institutions.},

To further strengthen this collaboration, Hyperledger Fabric (HF) can be prominently considered as a mean to implement next-generation secure and intelligent communication. However, implementing real-world applications on this platform may concern performance issues. For the constructive exploration of these issues, initially, we design a novel P2P energy trading framework for improving resource utilization and consequently addressing the impending electricity crisis challenge. Thenceforward, we evaluate the results based on the different system operational parameters for establishing a proof-of-concept. For determining performance bottlenecks and best-configuration, these results are investigated independently by using the Nectar Research Cloud, thereby sustaining scalability. The proposed evaluation approach will largely contribute to determining the system operational-level parameters of enterprise applications that will utilize the HF platform as their communication tool-support. In addition, a benchmark is presented based on the Hyperledger Caliper tool to facilitate application designers and developers in the form of selecting an appropriate implementation model across the two latest stable HF model versions. The illustrative CPS-enabled energy trading scenario corroborates the feasibility of the proposed framework to foster the development of HF-assisted smart P2P energy trading mechanisms.}

To leverage DLs at scale, their well-known limitation (i.e., performance) should be adequately analyzed and addressed. Directed acyclic graph-based DLs have been proposed to tackle the performance and scalability issues by design. The first among them, IOTA, has shown promising signs in addressing the preceding issues. IOTA is an open source DL designed for the Internet of Things. It uses a directed acyclic graph to store transactions on its ledger, to achieve a potentially higher scalability over blockchain-based DLs. However, due to the uncertainty and centralization of the deployed consensus, the current IOTA implementation exposes some performance issues, making it less performant than the initial design. In this article, we first extend an existing simulator to support realistic IOTA simulations and investigate the impact of different design parameters on IOTA’s performance. Then, we propose a layered model to help the users of IOTA determine the optimal waiting time to resend the previously submitted but not yet confirmed transaction. Our findings reveal the impact of the transaction arrival rate, tip selection algorithms, weighted tip selection algorithm randomness, and network delay on the throughput. Using the proposed layered model, we shed some light on the distribution of the confirmed transactions. The distribution is leveraged to calculate the optimal time for resending an unconfirmed transaction to the DL. The performance analysis results can be used by both system designers and users to support their decision making.},

This paper proposes a novel blockchain network construction methodology to improve the performance of Hyperledger Fabric. As a highly scalable permissioned blockchain platform, Hyperledger Fabric supports a wide range of enterprise use cases from finance to governance. A comprehensive evaluation is performed by observing various configurable network components that can affect the blockchain performance. To demonstrate the significance of the proposed methodology, we set up the experiment environment for the baseline and the test network using optimized parameters, respectively. The experimental results indicate that the test network's performance is enhanced effectively compared to the baseline in transaction throughput and transaction latency.}

Fabric, an open-source framework to implement the permissioned enterprise-grade blockchain, is getting increasing attention from innovators. The latency performance is crucial to the Fabric blockchain in assessing its effectiveness. Many empirical studies were conducted to analyze this performance based on different hardware platforms. These experimental results are not comparable as they are highly dependent on the underlying networks. Moreover, theoretical analysis on the latency of Fabric blockchain still receives much less attention. This paper provides a novel theoretical model to calculate the transaction latency under various network configurations such as block size, block interval, etc. Subsequently, we validate the proposed latency model with experiments, and the results show that the difference between analytical and experimental results is as low as 6.1%. We also identify some performance bottlenecks and give insights from the developer’s perspective.}

abstract = {Federated Learning (FL) is a distributed, and decentralized machine learning protocol. By executing FL, a set of agents can jointly train a model without sharing their datasets with each other, or a third-party. This makes FL particularly suitable for settings where data privacy is desired.At the same time, concealing training data gives attackers an opportunity to inject backdoors into the trained model. It has been shown that an attacker can inject backdoors to the trained model during FL, and then can leverage the backdoor to make the model misclassify later. Several works tried to alleviate this threat by designing robust aggregation functions. However, given more sophisticated attacks are developed over time, which by-pass the existing defenses, we approach this problem from a complementary angle in this work. Particularly, we aim to discourage backdoor attacks by detecting, and punishing the attackers, possibly after the end of training phase.To this end, we develop a hybrid blockchain-based FL framework that uses smart contracts to automatically detect, and punish the attackers via monetary penalties. Our framework is general in the sense that, any aggregation function, and any attacker detection algorithm can be plugged into it. We conduct experiments to demonstrate that our framework preserves the communication-efficient nature of FL, and provide empirical results to illustrate that it can successfully penalize attackers by leveraging our novel attacker detection algorithm.},

abstract = {Multi-organization data sharing is becoming increasingly prevalent due to the interconnectivity of systems and the need for collaboration across organizations (e.g., exchange of data in a supply chain involving multiple upstream and downstream vendors). There are, however, data security concerns due to lack of trust between organizations that may be located in jurisdictions with varying security and privacy legislation and culture (also referred to as a zero trust environment). Hence, in such a zero trust setting, one should introduce strengthened, yet efficient, access control mechanisms to facilitate cross-organizational data access and exchange requests. Contemporary access control schemes generally focus on protecting a single objective rather than multiple parties, due to higher security costs. In this article, we propose a blockchain-based access control scheme, designed to facilitate lightweight data sharing among different organizations. Specifically, our approach utilizes the consortium blockchain to establish a trustworthy environment, in which a Role-Based Access Control (RBAC) model is then deployed using our proposed multi-signature protocol and smart contract methods. Evaluation of our proposed approach is performed on the HyperLedger Fabric consortium blockchain platform using both Caliper and BFT-SMaRT benchmarks, and the findings demonstrate the utility of our approach.},

abstract = {The Internet of Things (IoT) aims to enable a scenario where smart objects, inserted into information networks, supply smart services for human beings. The introduction of edge computing in IoT can reduce the decision-making latency, save bandwidth resources, and expand the cloud services to be allocated at the network’s edge. However, edge-based IoT systems currently face challenges in their decentralized trust management. Trust management is essential to obtain reliable mining and data fusion, improved user privacy and data security, and provisioning of services with context-awareness. In this survey, we first examine the edge-based IoT architectures currently reported in the literature. Then a complete review of trust requirements in edge-based IoT systems is produced. Also, we discuss about blockchain as a solution to solve several trust problems in IoT and analyze in detail the correlation between blockchain and edge computing. Finally, we provide a detailed analysis of performance aspects of trusted edge-based IoT systems and recommend promising research directions.},

It is a growing research domain that studies deployment, migration, and optimization of applications in the form of microservices across cloud/edge infrastructure. It presents dynamically tailored microservices in technology-centric environments by exploiting edge and cloud platforms. Osmotic computing promotes digital transformation and furnishes benefits to transportation, smart cities, education, and healthcare. In this article, we present a comprehensive analysis of osmotic computing through a systematic literature review approach. To ensure high-quality review, we conduct an advanced search on numerous digital libraries to extracting related studies. The advanced search strategy identifies 99 studies, from which 29 relevant studies are selected for a thorough review. We present a summary of applications in osmotic computing build on their key features.

abstract = {Summary Blockchain technologies are expected to make a significant impact on a variety of industries. However, one issue holding them back is their limited transaction throughput, especially compared to established solutions such as distributed database systems. In this paper, we rearchitect a modern permissioned blockchain system, Hyperledger Fabric, to increase transaction throughput from 3000 to 20 000 transactions per second. We focus on performance bottlenecks beyond the consensus mechanism, and we propose architectural changes that reduce computation and I/O overhead during transaction ordering and validation to greatly improve throughput. Notably, our optimizations are fully plug-and-play and do not require any interface changes to Hyperledger Fabric.},

abstract = {Within the last few years, a countless number of blockchain systems have emerged on the market, each one claiming to revolutionize the way of distributed transaction processing in one way or the other. Many blockchain features, such as byzantine fault tolerance, are indeed valuable additions in modern environments. However, despite all the hype around the technology, many of the challenges that blockchain systems have to face are fundamental transaction management problems. These are largely shared with traditional database systems, which have been around for decades already. These similarities become especially visible for systems, that blur the lines between blockchain systems and classical database systems. A great example of this is Hyperledger Fabric, an open-source permissioned blockchain system under development by IBM. By implementing parallel transaction processing, Fabric's workflow is highly motivated by optimistic concurrency control mechanisms in classical database systems. This raises two questions: (1)~Which conceptual similarities and differences do actually exist between a system such as Fabric and a classical distributed database system? (2)~Is it possible to improve on the performance of Fabric by transitioning technology from the database world to blockchains and thus blurring the lines between these two types of systems even further? To tackle these questions, we first explore Fabric from the perspective of database research, where we observe weaknesses in the transaction pipeline. We then solve these issues by transitioning well-understood database concepts to Fabric, namely transaction reordering as well as early transaction abort. Our experimental evaluation under the Smallbank benchmark as well as under a custom workload shows that our improved version Fabric++ significantly increases the throughput of successful transactions over the vanilla version by up to a factor of 12x, while decreasing the average latency to almost half.},

abstract = {Blockchain is a key technology that has the potential to decentralize the way we store, share, and manage information and data. One of the more recent blockchain platforms that has emerged is Hyperledger Fabric, an open source, permissioned blockchain that was introduced by IBM, first as Hyperledger Fabric v0.6, and then more recently, in 2017, IBM released Hyperledger Fabric v1.0. Although there are many blockchain platforms, there is no clear methodology for evaluating and assessing the different blockchain platforms in terms of their various aspects, such as performance, security, and scalability. In addition, the new version of Hyperledger Fabric was never evaluated against any other blockchain platform. In this paper, we will first conduct a performance analysis of the two versions of Hyperledger Fabric, v0.6 and v1.0. The performance evaluation of the two platforms will be assessed in terms of execution time, latency, and throughput, by varying the workload in each platform up to 10,000 transactions. Second, we will analyze the scalability of the two platforms by varying the number of nodes up to 20 nodes in each platform. Overall, the performance analysis results across all evaluation metrics, scalability, throughput, execution time, and latency, demonstrate that Hyperledger Fabric v1.0 consistently outperforms Hyperledger Fabric v0.6. However, Hyperledger Fabric v1.0 platform performance did not reach the performance level in current traditional database systems under high workload scenarios.},

abstract = {Large cloud providers such as AWS and IBM now provide managed blockchain platforms, showcasing an active interest in blockchains. Unfortunately, blockchains provide poor performance and scalability. This is true even for the Execute-Order-Validate (EOV) style of blockchains which improves over the traditional Order-Execute architecture. We experimentally show that EOV platforms scale poorly using both vertical and horizontal scaling approaches. We find that the throughput is bottlenecked by the Validation and Commit phases, which poorly utilize the resources, limiting performance and scalability.We introduce three ideas to improve the performance, scalability, and cost-efficiency of EOV platforms. We first propose a provably correct way to pipeline the Validation and Commit phases. We then introduce a new type of node called sparse peer that validates and commits only a subset of transactions. Finally, we propose a technique that makes it possible for these systems to elastically scale as per the load. Our implementation provides 3.7x and 2.1x higher throughput than Hyperledger Fabric and FastFabric for the same infrastructure cost while providing their peak throughputs at 87\% and 50\% lower cost. It also makes dynamic horizontal scaling practical by providing 12-26X faster scale-up times.},

Hyperledger Fabric Performance Model 2024, 2025



From these figures, it can be observed that the TPS
represents another factor that impacts the Failure Rate. For
example, Figure 9 shows that the failure is higher with
100 users than 200 users if the TPS configuration is 200
during the test, indicating that the system is under greater pressure and more challenges at higher transaction rates.
Therefore, the findings imply that the quantity of virtual
users affects the system’s performance. The study also
revealed that while some system modules had higher send
rates and throughput and lower failure rates, others had
higher delays.

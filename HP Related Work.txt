Blockchain technology is extensively employed across various industries, transforming conventional processes, and enhancing efficiency, security, and transparency. The decentralized nature of blockchain prevents any single entity from having control, fostering trust, and minimizing the risk of manipulation. Proposing a blockchain solution is not enough as the success and adoption of such solutions heavily depends on the overall performance. The performance of the blockchain based solutions can be measured using various metrics such as latency, throughput, and CPU utilization. This study is using throughput as a performance metric and demonstrating how the Hyperledger Caliper tool can be used to measure it. To illustrate the use of Hyperledger Caliper, a scenario has been devised involving the presence of multiple organizations and peers within the blockchain network. This test-network comprises three organizations, three certificate authorities, three orderer-nodes and three peers per organization. The proposed network is set up using Hyperledger Fabric blockchain framework. This scenario depicts how remote patient monitoring systems work in a multi-organization environment. The experiment results observe a very minute difference in send rate and throughput when data is injected at 80 and 100 TPS during the write operations but this difference is missing during the read operations as send rate and throughput is observed almost identical.


3. Enhancing Throughput in Hyperledger Fabric Through Endorsement Policy Strategy：https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=10673946
In the realm of private permissioned blockchain platforms, increasing throughput is a pivotal objective. This paper focuses on the optimization of throughput in Hyperledger Fabric, a private permissioned leading blockchain framework tailored for enterprise applications. The paper proposes a novel approach to enhancing the platform’s performance by reevaluating the endorsement policy. By implementing a Less-Than-Half endorsement policy, the paper aims to streamline transaction validation processes and bridge the gap between Fabric’s throughput and the demands of large-scale industrial applications. The proposed method objects to boost transaction throughput without compromising security or reliability. The paper provides an overview of Hyperledger Fabric architecture, discusses the pre-verification mechanism, and presents the proposed method for optimizing throughput. The performance of the system is analyzed using Hyperledger Caliper and Prometheus. Simulation results show increase in the throughput of the Less-Than-Half of the endorsement policy as compared to the majority and it also demonstrates the significant reduction in the latency of the Less-Than-Half endorsement policy.

5. Performance Optimization of High-Conflict Transactions within the Hyperledger Fabric Blockchain：https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=10732190
Hyperledger Fabric (HLF) is a blockchain (BC) platform that supports secure high-throughput and low-latency transactions. However, it encounters challenges in managing conflicting transactions that negatively affect throughput and latency. This paper proposes a novel solution to address these challenges and improve performance. Our solution involves reallocating the Multi-Version Concurrency Control (MVCC) from the validation phase to a preceding stage in the transaction flow in order to enable early detection of conflicting transactions. Specifically, we propose and evaluate two innovative modifications, called Orderer Early MVCC (OEMVCC) and OEMVCC with Execution Avoidance (OEMVCC-EA). Our experimental evaluation results demonstrate significant throughput and latency improvements, providing a practical solution for high-conflict applications that demand high performance.


6. Performance Modeling and Evaluation of Hyperledger Fabric: An Analysis Based on Transaction Flow and Endorsement Policies：https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=10733701
Blockchain is a paradigm derived from distributed systems, protocols, and security concepts. However, can blockchain applications provide services in industrial environments, especially concerning performance issues? In blockchains, long response times can impair both user and service experience, and intensive resource use may increase the costs of service provision. The proposed paper tries to answer this question by evaluating the performance of one of the most popular permissioned blockchain platforms, the Hyperledger Fabric (HLF). We provide a framework for performance evaluation based on modeling and experimentation. The results indicate that block size and arrival rate can compromise throughput (by -70%), latency (by +1,500%), and environment utilization (by +28%) and that multiple gateways can reduce latency (by -75%), and throughput (by -60%).










10. Hyperledger Fabric Platform for Secure and Efficient Data Sharing in Autonomous Vehicles： https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=10657518 （see the results）
Advancements in wireless communication, en-compassing cellular and non-terrestrial networks, are empow-ering Autonomous Vehicles (AVs) to revolutionize transportation. The achievement of real-time data exchange and seamless communication with infrastructure promises a future of safer and more efficient travel. However, the significant challenge of efficiently managing the extensive data generated by AVs persists. This data includes sensor readings, information about the surrounding environment, and potentially user data. Consequently, addressing concerns related to data processing, sharing among various stakeholders, privacy, integrity, and security is of utmost importance. This paper tackles the data sharing challenge by proposing and evaluating a platform built on Hyperledger Fabric, a blockchain technology. This platform aims to facilitate secure and efficient data sharing between all parties involved with AVs. Our initial testing reveals that the number of simulated users (virtual user count) and the amount of data processed (data load) can negatively impact the system's performance. This highlights the need for further optimization to ensure the platform can handle large-scale data sharing effectively.


11. Mission Reliability and Optimization in Multi-agent Systems Using Hyperledger Fabric Platform: https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=10955996
This paper investigates the mission reliability and agent number optimization in a multi-agent system (MAS) under the presence of Byzantine agents transmitting malicious information. We propose a novel hierarchical model of MAS based on the Hyperledger Fabric blockchain. This model incorporates a P2P communication network and smart contracts, enabling the calculation of mission reliability, optimal decisions-making, and the detection and isolation of Byzantine agents. The blockchain approach presented in this study provides an interface for reliability calculation, facilitates optimal number of agent selection, and accurately identifies Byzantine agents for secure consensus control. Experimental simulations are performed using the ARGoS robot swarm simulator to demonstrate the security and effectiveness of the proposed method.


12. Dynamic Optimization for Trade-off in Hyperledger Fabric towards Latency-Sensitive IoT Services: https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=10707554
Hyperledger Fabric is currently the most widely used open-source enterprise blockchain platform in IoT services. However, Hyperledger Fabric still suffers from high latency in practical applications, hindering its further adoption in latency-sensitive IoT services. To address this issue, this paper selects Hyperledger Fabric v2.0 as the research target. The focus is on the latency of the ordering phase, which accounts for the highest proportion of latency in the EOV architecture. The ordering phase is primarily responsible for block packaging and generation, requiring careful parameter configuration to ensure the efficient operation of the blockchain system. We discuss the impact of BatchSize and BatchTimeout on block generation under two different consensus algorithms, Kafka and Raft. Additionally, based on the M/M/1 queue, we propose a latency analysis model for the ordering phase and analyze the causes of latency. Subsequently, we frame the optimization of blockchain experimentation as a Markov decision process, introducing a dynamic parameter configuration method grounded in deep reinforcement learning. This approach aims to strike a balance between BatchSize and BatchTimeout in response to network loads. The experimental results indicate that compared to existing methods, the proposed dynamic optimization strategy can reduce the average transaction latency of the blockchain system by 11.37%. Additionally, this strategy demonstrates good fault tolerance capability, with a reduction in the latency of node failures by approximately 6.35%. Therefore, the proposed dynamic optimization strategy meets the QoS requirements for IoT services.

13. Electronic Healthcare Data Sharing Application Based on Hyperledger Consortium Blockchain Network: https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=11102758
The fragmentation of medical data, lack of patient ownership over medical records, and the persistent risk of data breaches represent significant challenges in the electronic healthcare sector. This research leverages blockchain technology and decentralized principles to address these issues by proposing a novel medical data-sharing system and business network model, with patient-owned medical records as the central asset. The proposed model ensures that ownership of medical records is unequivocally assigned to patients, granting them sole authority to authorize access to their personal health information. Furthermore, the system guarantees the immutability and chronological integrity of medical records. To realize this model, we implement a consortium blockchain network utilizing the Hyperledger Fabric framework, complemented by the Hyperledger Composer toolset for constructing the business network. The interstellar File System (IPFS) serves as a distributed storage solution, while the Angular framework facilitates the development of interactive web applications. Advanced technologies, including Docker, are employed to seamlessly integrate technical and business components, culminating in a fully functional blockchain-based application for medical data sharing. This application, accessible via web interfaces, empowers patients with control over their data, enhances security, and fosters a tamper-proof, interoperable healthcare ecosystem. Our findings demonstrate the potential of Hyperledger Fabric-based solutions to revolutionize data management in electronic healthcare, offering a scalable and patient-centric approach to medical record stewardship.

15. Operating ZKPs on Blockchain: A Performance Analysis Based on Hyperledger Fabric: https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=10646455
Preserving privacy in blockchain-based systems is crucial for ensuring anonymity and confidentiality during transactions. While cryptographic solutions can address on-chain privacy concerns, their implementation on blockchains may introduce performance overhead, which remains unclear to researchers and practitioners. This paper investigates the performance impact of integrating zero-knowledge proofs (ZKPs) into the widely adopted permissioned blockchain framework called Hyperledger Fabric. The study focuses on evaluating the scalability and bottleneck aspects of blockchain platforms incorporating ZKPs. Through comprehensive experimentation and analysis, the study reveals that the integration of ZKPs compromises performance in terms of transaction rates and latency, while effectively safeguarding users’ personal information. Implementing on-chain ZKP feature would result in a performance loss of 30% to 87.5% in various experimental configurations in Hyperledger Fabric. The findings presented in this paper are informative for the design and implementation of blockchain-based systems with strict privacy requirements。


16. Decentralized Access Control using Hyperledger Fabric: https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=11126662
Traditional access control systems often use the extensible access control markup language (XACML), a widely adopted standard for defining and enforcing access control policies. XACML is flexible and compatible with various access control models. It comprises key components such as the Policy Decision Point (PDP), Policy Enforcement Point (PEP), Policy Administration Point (PAP), and Policy Information Point (PIP), which are centrally managed in traditional setups. However, this central management introduces vulnerabilities like Single Point of Failure (SPOF) and other security risks. This research addresses these challenges by proposing a decentralized access control architecture built on Hyperledger Fabric. The design distributes the four core components of XACML— PEP, PDP, PAP, and PIP- across multiple blockchain nodes, eliminating SPOF while enhancing scalability and data integrity. A proof of concept (PoC) implementation is developed to evaluate the system’s performance. The architecture and PoC are analyzed against predefined threats and requirements, demonstrating how the system delivers a secure, scalable, and resilient access control solution.


17. A Scheduling Algorithm for Hyperledger Fabric Based on Transaction Batch Processing: https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=10705406
Hyperledger Fabric (Fabric for short), is a consortium blockchain platform that adopts the smart contract paradigm and provides complete operational functions. Although it has become the system with the highest throughput among open source blockchain systems, its performance cannot meet the needs of industrial-grade application scenarios. To further expand the application scenarios of blockchain, this paper proposes a Transaction Batch Processing Scheduling (TBPS) algorithm for multi-channel Fabric networks based on Lyapunov optimization theory. The algorithm maximizes the consensus efficiency of the system while ensuring the minimum transaction accumulation, and provides stability conditions and optimal performance for the system under transaction batch processing. Finally, we built a blockchain network of Fabric’s latest stable version v 2.0 via the cloud platform, providing an order of magnitude of algorithmic parameters by testing transaction processing rates. To simulate the distribution of performance indicators such as transaction delay, system transaction accumulation and average transaction processing rate under different impact factors, and verify the effectiveness of the proposed TBPS algorithm.

From these figures, it can be observed that the TPS represents another factor that impacts the Failure Rate. For example, Figure 9 shows that the failure is higher with 100 users than 200 users if the TPS configuration is 200 during the test, indicating that the system is under greater pressure and more challenges at higher transaction rates. Therefore, the findings imply that the quantity of virtual users affects the system’s performance. The study also revealed that while some system modules had higher send rates and throughput and lower failure rates, others had higher delays.
